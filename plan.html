  <h1> Project Plan</h1>
  <h1> Mini Site 2 - Training Zone</h1>
  <p>&lt;Ramesh Durai (jc310886)&gt; </p>
<h2>Mission Statement</h2>
  <p><br>
  The project will consist of the creation of a website, with the intent to increase revenue through the promotion of provided services, as well as displaying announcements and relevant information 
on a website, reducing the need for staff to answer queries over the phone.<br>
  </p>
  <h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p>Advertising on the site will be consistent, and the only major change to the company's daily runnings. As such, any changes to the sales of the business can logically be attributed to the website. <br>
The performance of the site will be measured over a 3 month period, and the numbers of customers the business has be used as the measure of the website's success.</p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>The target audience will remain the majority customer of the company, specifically adults aged between 28-50 years old, largely corporate professionals to tertiary educatiion students. As such, the website will not need to be tailored to entertain children or cater to senior citizens, the style should be promt and straightforward, with a focus on the provision of services with as little fuss as possible, and the minimum of handholding.</p>
